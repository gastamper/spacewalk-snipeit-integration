# spacewalk-snipeit-integration
This project allows for using Spacewalk as a source for automatically importing and updating assets in Snipe-IT.

# Usage:
 - snipedump: dumps fields from any individual asset in Snipe, for configuration of integrator
 - integrator: performs the actual API dump between the two systems
